# CULearn (Backend-Flask)
Backend for CULearn, a app to help connect students to tutors at Cornell University. There is a home screen for tutors and students to display their profiles which include
time availability, price, subjects, and more. The database implemented in this app allows for students to connect with tutors and vice versa once they are matched together.
